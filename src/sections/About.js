        <Description>
          From power grids and water systems to healthcare, mobile devices, manufacturing, and logistics, the growth of
          data creation is remarkable for its volume and criticality. Where once data was primarily a side-effect of
          successful business operations, today it is a vital element in the smooth operation of all aspects of daily
          life for consumers, governments, and businesses alike.

        <Description>
          Without data, the AI models are not accurate. With no accuracy, the AI model is unusable. The winners so far
