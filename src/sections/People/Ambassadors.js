No, just a regular mistake. Bender, you risked your life to save me! Morbo can not understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that is shaped like a man wearing a hat.\n\nNay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Bender, this is Frys decisionâ€¦ and he made it wrong. So it is time for us to interfere in his life.',
