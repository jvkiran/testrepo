                "question": "What is Ocean Protocol?",
                "answer": "Ocean Protocol is a tokenized service layer that exposes data, storage, compute and algorithms for consumption with a set of deterministic proofs on availability and integrity that serve as verifiable service agreements. There is staking on services to signal quality, reputation and ward against Sybil Attacks.<br><br>Ocean helps to unlock data, particularly for AI. It is designed for scale and uses blockchain technology that allows data to be shared and sold in a safe, secure and transparent manner."
            },
            {
                "question": "How does Ocean Protocol work?",
                "answer": "Ocean Protocol is at once a business, technical, and governance framework that is interwoven together to allow data and services to be shared and sold, in a secure manner. Ocean Protocol stores metadata, links to data, provides a licensing framework and has toolsets for pricing. A multitude of data marketplaces can hook into Ocean Protocol to provide “last mile” services to connect data providers and consumers. Ocean Protocol is designed so that data owners cannot be locked-in to any single marketplace. The data owner controls each dataset."
            },
            {
                "question": "What problem does Ocean Protocol solve?",
                "answer": "Ocean Protocol unlocks data so it can be used productively.<br><br>The world’s data is growing exponentially yet is massively under-utilized. Most companies have tremendous amounts of data, but have difficulty exploiting it. Conversely, many others are starving for data, particularly in AI. Ocean Protocol allows data providers to share data, while maintaining control and having transparency."
            },
            {
                "question": "Who are the main participants in Ocean Protocol?",
                "answer": "The main actors in Ocean Protocol are data providers, data consumers, data marketplaces, service providers and network keepers. Data providers offer data. Data consumers obtain data for their own use. Data marketplaces connect data producers and data consumers. Service providers provision computation, storage and algorithms for sale. Network keepers support Ocean’s protocol by running nodes within the network. Please refer to our <a href=\"#papers\">Marketplace Framework<\/a> for more details."

                "question": "Who are Ocean Protocol’s competitors?",
                "answer": "Ocean is a protocol and network on which data marketplaces can be built to unlock data for sharing and selling. It enables data to be shared. Most other projects are decentralized / centralized marketplaces or data brokers. Ocean is complementary to both centralized & decentralized marketplaces, because it provides an additional channel for the marketplaces to publish their services. We consider projects like Enigma and Datum to be potential partners."

                "answer": "Ocean Tokens act as the native internal currency that is inseparable from the protocol and network. Tokens can be used to buy and sell data and services, incentivize the curation of public data and reward network keepers to maintain the network."

The overall Pre-Launch target is 18M€ in exchange for 90 million Ocean Tokens at a price of 0.20€/Ocean Token representing 6.4% of the token supply, half from institutional investors and half from the community.<br><br>The Network Launch Token distribution will be held in Q1/2019 when the network is ready.

                "question": "Why are there two public token distributions - Pre-Launch and Network Launch?",
                "answer": "The Pre-Launch funds will be used to build the protocol, network and ecosystem. Once we’ve succeeded, then we’ve earned the right to ask the community to fund the next phase to scale the ecosystem. We believe that this is fair and accountable to the community."

                "answer": "Acquirors that obtain Ocean Tokens in the Pre-Launch will be subject to a linear vesting of 6 months starting from the Network Launch Token Distribution date, scheduled for Q1 2019. This means that the total hold period is of about 18 months until an acquiror receives 100% of their Ocean tokens.
