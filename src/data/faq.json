      {
        "question": "What is Ocean Protocol?",
        "answer": "Ocean Protocol is a tokenized service layer that exposes data, storage, compute and algorithms for consumption with a set of deterministic proofs on availability and integrity that serve as verifiable service agreements. There is staking on services to signal quality, reputation and ward against Sybil Attacks.<br><br>Ocean helps to unlock data, particularly for AI. It is designed for scale and uses blockchain technology that allows data to be shared and sold in a safe, secure and transparent manner."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Ocean Protocol work?",
        "answer": "Ocean Protocol is at once a business, technical, and governance framework that is interwoven together to allow data and services to be shared and sold, in a secure manner. Ocean Protocol stores metadata, links to data, provides a licensing framework and has toolsets for pricing. A multitude of data marketplaces can hook into Ocean Protocol to provide “last mile” services to connect data providers and consumers. Ocean Protocol is designed so that data owners cannot be locked-in to any single marketplace. The data owner controls each dataset."
      },
      {
        "question": "What problem does Ocean Protocol solve?",
        "answer": "Ocean Protocol unlocks data so it can be used productively.<br><br>The world’s data is growing exponentially yet is massively under-utilized. Most companies have tremendous amounts of data, but have difficulty exploiting it. Conversely, many others are starving for data, particularly in AI. Ocean Protocol allows data providers to share data, while maintaining control and having transparency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who are the main participants in Ocean Protocol?",
        "answer": "The main actors in Ocean Protocol are data providers, data consumers, data marketplaces, service providers and network keepers. Data providers offer data. Data consumers obtain data for their own use. Data marketplaces connect data producers and data consumers. Service providers provision computation, storage and algorithms for sale. Network keepers support Ocean’s protocol by running nodes within the network. Please refer to our <a href=\"#papers\">Marketplace Framework<\/a> for more details."

    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "What is Ocean Protocol Foundation?",
        "answer": "It is a Singapore based non-profit foundation. Its mandate is to ensure open access to the protocol and platform, provide long-term governance, community and ecosystem, and be a custodian of funds raised. DEX Pte Ltd and BigchainDB GmBH are the founders of Ocean Protocol Foundation Limited. "
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the relationship between Ocean Protocol and DEX?",
        "answer": "The DEX product is an apache licensed reference marketplace built on Ocean Protocol. All other data marketplaces can re-use the DEX code and logic to build marketplace products."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the relationship between Ocean Protocol and BigchainDB?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Does Ocean Protocol use BigchainDB?",
        "answer": "BigchainDB is a persistent data store with blockchain characteristics of decentralized control, security and assets. Ocean Protocol does not use BigchainDB except as one of the many potential services to integrate into."

    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Who are Ocean Protocol’s competitors?",
        "answer": "Ocean is a protocol and network on which data marketplaces can be built to unlock data for sharing and selling. It enables data to be shared. Most other projects are decentralized / centralized marketplaces or data brokers. Ocean is complementary to both centralized & decentralized marketplaces, because it provides an additional channel for the marketplaces to publish their services. We consider projects like Enigma and Datum to be potential partners."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who are Ocean’s partners and early customers?",
        "answer": "Singapore is the lead government partner for Ocean Protocol. Singapore is supporting an 18-month development roadmap with DEX and Ocean Protocol Foundation. We are partnering up with numerous multinationals from insurance, pharma, automotive, and other industries to develop the technology and provide data.<br><br>Please refer to our token distribution document for more details."

            "question": "What is the role of the Ocean Token?",
            "answer": "Ocean Tokens act as the native internal currency that is inseparable from the protocol and network. Tokens can be used to buy and sell data and services, incentivize the curation of public data and reward network keepers to maintain the network."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is Ocean Token an ERC20 token?",
            "answer": "Ocean Tokens will be issued as a native token for the Ocean network. It will not be issued as an ERC20 token."

        },
        {
            "question": "What are the details for the Ocean Token distribution?",
            "answer": "Please refer to our <a href=\"#papers\">token distribution document<\/a> or <a href=\"https://blog.oceanprotocol.com\">blog<\/a> for more details.<br><br>From January 2018 onwards, Ocean Protocol Foundation will release 11.5% of Ocean Tokens to acquirers in two phases - Pre-Launch Token distribution and Network Launch Token distributions. <br><br>The Pre-Launch distribution will have both an early access for institutions (January 2018) as well as a public distribution starting on March 7th, 2018 that is open to all qualified acquirors. The overall Pre-Launch target is 18M€ in exchange for 90 million Ocean Tokens at a price of 0.20€/Ocean Token representing 6.4% of the token supply, half from institutional investors and half from the community.<br><br>The Network Launch Token distribution will be held in Q1/2019 when the network is ready. The target raise and token price are not yet set, however 5.1% of the token supply (71.5 million Ocean Tokens) will be released."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why are there two public token distributions - Pre-Launch and Network Launch?",
            "answer": "The Pre-Launch funds will be used to build the protocol, network and ecosystem. Once we’ve succeeded, then we’ve earned the right to ask the community to fund the next phase to scale the ecosystem. We believe that this is fair and accountable to the community."
        },

        {
            "question": "Does being whitelisted guarantee that I will be able to contribute?",
            "answer": "We expect that some contributors will not take up their entire allocation amount, so there is a good likelihood that most of the people whitelisted will be able to contribute, but this isn’t guaranteed. The individual cap is designed so that if everyone contributes the maximum amount, 72% of the whitelisted contributors will be able to contribute. <br><br>If someone contributes after the cap has already been reached, their funds will be reimbursed to the same wallet from which it came from. Also, anyone that contributes more than the individual cap will receive the excess funds back."

            "answer": "A complete guide about storing Ocean Tokens in your wallet will come closer to network launch. Please note that as it is a native token (and not ethereum-based or ERC20), you will not be able to store the tokens in Ethereum wallets (such as MyEthereumWallet). We will develop our own wallet by the network launch time."

            "question": "For how long will the token received during the public pre-launch, be locked?",
            "answer": "Acquirors that obtain Ocean Tokens in the Pre-Launch will be subject to a linear vesting of 6 months starting from Network Launch. This means that the total hold period is 18 months until an acquiror receives 100% of their Ocean tokens. This encourages long-term community members to participate and disincentives speculators."

            "question": "Is it possible to provide P.O. box No. as a proof of residence?",
            "answer": "No, we cannot accept only P.O. box No. as a proof of address.  A proof of residence must have identifiable parameters such as street name / no. House No., etc. and the entire address should be reflected on your proof of address. If you live in a rural area that does not have regular street names and numbers, please provide other documentation such as your land title deed, rental contract and other materials that can help the KYC team make a determination in your favor."
