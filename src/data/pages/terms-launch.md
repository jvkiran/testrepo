For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms govern only the Whitelisting, and DO NOT govern a Whitelist Registrant’s participation in the Initial Token Exchange, which participation shall be the subject of separate terms and conditions (“Initial Token Exchange Terms”) to be entered into between the Foundation and Whitelist Registrant at a future date. Only Whitelist Registrants who are registered on the Whitelist and who fulfil the Initial Token Exchange Terms, will be eligible to participate in the Initial Token Exchange.
