## Introduction

Our Privacy Policy sets out how your personal information is collected and used while you use our site. We believe your personal information belongs to you, so we are very open about how we use it.

If you have questions about the Privacy Policy, want to know what data we store about you, or if you want to withdraw your consent to any data processing, let us know by emailing [gdpr@oceanprotocol.com](mailto:gdpr@oceanprotocol.com).

## Our Policies

We collect and use information in accordance with the GDPR, or with your specific and express consent. We may process your data outside of the EU but regardless of where we process it, we will always conform to EU level data privacy and data protection standards.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18 without consent from a parent or guardian. If we learn a child has provided personal information, we may delete it.

## What Information We Collect and How We Use It

When you visit our site, we don’t log any information about your visit on the server (technically, S3 bucket). We also don’t load any 3rd party scripts tracking your indiviual behavior across multiple channels, like A/B testing tools, social network or sharing buttons, and so on.

We simply don’t measure your engagement with our brand based on tracking you, because we believe this is always in violation of your privacy, and ultimately meaningless.

To conform to legal requirements of various jurisdictions, we might adapt certain parts of the site based on your detected location. We do this with [Cloudflare's Geo IP header](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168236-What-does-Cloudflare-IP-Geolocation-do-), which is read out on the client-side when you visit the site. We never store or further process that information.

### Web Services

The site communicates against those services where some data collection, like time of request and the user's IP address might be collected:

-   [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com), subject to their [Terms](https://www.cloudflare.com/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)
-   [Zeit](https://zeit.co/), subject to their [Terms](https://zeit.co/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://zeit.co/privacy)
-   [Webtask/Auth0](https://auth0.com), subject to their [Terms](https://auth0.com/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://auth0.com/privacy)

Additionally, if you are submitting one of our web forms, your entered data is stored and processed with:

-   [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/), subject to their [Terms](https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/)
-   [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), subject to their [Terms](https://zapier.com/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://zapier.com/privacy/)

### Cookies

When you first arrive on our site, a cookie banner will be shown. This will be accepted automatically on either of these conditions:

-   you stay on the landing page for more than 10 seconds
-   you browse to another page

On our site, only Google Analytics and YouTube set cookies. We have to set a cookie of our own though, for remembering your acceptance or rejection of our cookie banner. This cookie will stay in your browser for 13 months, unless you delete it manually. This is so we can detect your acceptance or rejection on your next visit, and adapt the site accordingly.

If you have Do Not Track activated in your browser, or if you rejected our cookie banner, we won’t let Google set any cookies in your browser.

You also have the option of disabling cookies in your browser setting, and deleting cookies from your computer’s hard disk at any time.

In general, you can block cookies by using your browser’s settings, or by installing a browser add-on such as [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) or [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

### Google Analytics

The site uses Google Analytics, which provides us with anonymized information about our users (such as anonymized IP address, browser version, and so on) and how they use the site. We use this information to make the site better.

The collected IP addresses are truncated before being sent to Google, making them anonymized. Google Analytics also sets cookies.

If you hit _Reject_ on the cookie banner, all previously set Google cookies will be deleted, and the rejection is stored in a cookie `hasConsent` with value of `false`.
