      "We (at BigchainDB) started working with Toyota Research Institute (TRI) in early 2017 for self-driving cars. The accident rate of self-driving cars reduces with higher model accuracy. Models get more accurate with more data. TRI had calculated that it needed 500 billion to 1 trillion miles driven in order to get models that were sufficiently accurate for production deployment of self-driving cars (and this is on top of orders of magnitude more miles driven in world simulators). TRI saw that each automaker faced similar challenges; and that it would be prohibitively expensive for each automaker on its own to generate that much data. So why not pool the data, via a data marketplace?"
